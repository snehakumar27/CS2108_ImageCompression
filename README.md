# CS2108 Image Compression

**Authors:** Sneha Kumar, Ng Siew Zhang

**Objective:** Image compression is a field that has been thoroughly researched, with a wide range of applications in tasks such as digital image storage and transmission. Drawing inspiration from these well-established methods, this project aims to investigate non Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) methods for JPEG-like image compression using MATLAB. 

**Methods:** Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are compared and experimented in combination with Quantization and Huffman Encoding and novel approaches such as pooling and frequency filters to improve the compression results. 

**Evaluation:** The performance of FFT and SVD are evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Structural Similar Index Measure (SSIM), Compression ratio and Storage ratio.
